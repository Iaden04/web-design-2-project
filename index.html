    <h2> What does Studio Ghibli mean?</h2>
    <p class="meaning-text">The name “Ghibli” was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli (also used in English), based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind (قبلي, ghiblī), the idea being that the studio would “blow a new wind through the anime industry”.[9][10] It also refers to an Italian aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309. Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as “Giburi” (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the studio is romanised in Japanese as Jiburi (ジブリ)</p>

    <h2> History</h2>
    <p>
      Founded on June 15, 1985, Studio Ghibli was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun in 1968 and the Panda! Go, Panda! 
    </p>
    <p>
      The studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Suzuki was part of the film's production team, and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join them.
